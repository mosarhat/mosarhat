### About Me

Heyo, I'm Mohammed Sarhat -- a student currently pursuing a degree in **Computing at Queen's University**, slated to graduate in **2026**. I'm super interested in Software Development, and want to push myself to become the best I can be in this field. 

### What I've Been Working On (Long-Term Projects)
The following repositories are all for personal use, and document my active learning experience. I plan on working on these for a prolonged period of time. As I am a student, this will take some time. My goal is to have a good set of personal documentation (spending 1-2 hours a day on average per week) done by my graduation time. I will be working on projects while working on this. 

I've made a note to include as many refrences as I can throughout my documentation. They don't follow a particular citation standard, but links are available for every single topic that I've decided to research. 

- [**JavaScript Practice**](https://github.com/mosarhat/js-practice): I'm taking a deep dive into learning JavaScript. While much of it is review, there's still a lot I don't know, and I'm excited to explore. 
- [**HTML Practice**](https://github.com/mosarhat/html-practice): This is going to be mainly review, but there are topics I'm unaware of. I've decided to include topics regarding accessibiliity, as my brother has Autism, and it's something I want to hold to a super high regard when it comes to designed solutions to problems.
- [**CSS Practice**](https://github.com/mosarhat/css-practice): CSS is probably my weakest link, and I've made an exceptional push to learn as much CSS as I possibly can. This will be exhaustive.
- [**Vanilla JS Practice**](https://github.com/mosarhat/vanilla-js-practice): I believe understanding Vanilla JavaScript is crucial for building a strong foundation, especially for frameworks like React, Svelte, or Angular. I've used React before, but I want to master the finer details of what precedes it. The repository mainly covers the DOM, and Events.
- [**React Practice**](https://github.com/mosarhat/react-practice): Revisting React, and building from the ground up. This mainly uses FSO (Full Stack Open), and Scrimba as a resource. This is partly review, but this will cover all the bases for strong React development.
- [**LeetCode Grind**](https://github.com/mosarhat/leetcode-grind): I'm solving LeetCode problems to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. While I'm still exploring, I'm committed to consistently improving.

### What I Plan On Working On
- Discord Bot: TBD.
- A Vanilla JS website that will be converted to React.
- CISC332 Website using PHP and MySQL.
- A personal website, with a blog, and portfolio showcase, using React. This is for me to write about more advanced topics I've learned in the future regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Pomodoro Website Using Vanilla JS. I want to keep this code as light-weight as possible.
- Build a website that inputs text, and provides sentiment analysis. However, you cannot use an API to do the sentiment analysis. Must use Python/Flask.
- Build a website that scores the similarity of phrases by using a paper. This is good practice as it will help us learn to use research to implement solutions to our problems. The paper at hand; https://semanticsimilarity.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/10-1109tkde-2006-130-authors-accepted-version.pdf.
- A small language model using PyTorch. This will be completley self-taught, and my progress will be documented in-depth within the README.md.
- A polyfill for JavaScript: TBD.
- A data analysis project that analyzes a dataset (TBD), and produces descriptive, and survival analysis.
- A data anlysis project that analyzes a dataset (TBD), and runs it through traditional machine learning models, neural networks, and deep learning models.
- A React Native project that utilizes Expo to create an iPhone, and Android app for users. I want to make this for people with disabilities, so when they take a picture of a given item, it gives a description both in-text, and to speech (upon clicking the test).
- A project using Svelte.
- A project using Angular.
- Capstone project for school -- TBD.

### Previous Projects
- [**ReceiptPal**](https://github.com/clairewhelan/qhacks_2025): A project developed during **QHacks 2025** that simplifies expense tracking and visualization. Built using **React** for the frontend, **Flask** for the backend, and integrated with **Firebase** for real-time data storage. Utilized **RESTful APIs** for seamless communication between components and **Charts.js** for dynamic and interactive data visualization.
